# sc-interns-2024

My approach on the technical take home for 2024 internship applications.

## Modifications:

### Component 1:

I have modifed the function signature of component 1 to return an error alongside the value.
This is in line with the return from component 2

### Sample.json

I have created a new sample.json with a slimmed down selection of folders based off of the greek alphabet.
Functionally it remains the same as the provided "sample.json" which has been renamed to "old_sample.json"

# Packages:

The only external package used but not provided within the original file is "logrus", a package designed to have different error logging levels. This is available [here](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus).
